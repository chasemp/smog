## Core Philosophy

**TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.** Every single line of production code must be written in response to a failing test. No exceptions. This is not a suggestion or a preference - it is the fundamental practice that enables all other principles in this document.

I follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) with a strong emphasis on behavior-driven testing and functional programming principles. All work should be done in small, incremental changes that maintain a working state throughout development.

## Quick Reference

**Key Principles:**

- Write tests first (TDD)
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Strict type safety (no `any`, `typing.Any`, or `interface{}` without justification)
- Immutable data only
- Small, pure functions
- Use real schemas/types in tests, never redefine them

**Supported Languages:**

- **TypeScript**: Strict mode, Jest/Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Python**: Type hints with mypy, pytest, no mutable defaults
- **Go**: Strict compilation, table-driven tests, explicit errors

Choose the language that best fits the domain - TypeScript for web/frontend, Python for data/ML/scripting, Go for systems/performance.

## Testing Principles

**Core principle**: Test behavior, not implementation. 100% coverage through business behavior.

**Quick reference:**
- Write tests first (TDD non-negotiable)
- Test through public API exclusively
- Use factory functions for test data (no mutable setup in `beforeEach`/fixtures)
- Tests must document expected business behavior
- No 1:1 mapping between test files and implementation files

**Testing Tools by Language:**
- **TypeScript**: Jest, Vitest, React Testing Library
- **Python**: pytest (with fixtures for immutable setup), unittest
- **Go**: standard `testing` package, table-driven tests

For detailed testing patterns and examples, load the `testing` skill.
For verifying test effectiveness through mutation analysis, load the `mutation-testing` skill.

## Type Safety Guidelines

**Core principle**: Strict typing always. Schema-first at trust boundaries, types for internal logic.

**TypeScript:**
- No `any` types - use `unknown` if type truly unknown
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for data structures
- Define schemas first, derive types (Zod/Standard Schema)

**Python:**
- Always use type hints (PEP 484)
- No `typing.Any` - use `object` or `typing.Protocol` if needed
- Use Pydantic/dataclasses for schemas at boundaries
- Run mypy in strict mode

**Go:**
- No `interface{}` without clear justification - use generics (Go 1.18+)
- Explicit error handling (never ignore errors)
- Use struct tags for validation/serialization

For detailed TypeScript patterns, load the `typescript-strict` skill.
For Python type patterns, use built-in type system with runtime validation at boundaries.
For Go patterns, follow standard library conventions.

## Code Style

**Core principle**: Functional programming with immutable data. Self-documenting code.

**Quick reference:**
- No data mutation - immutable data structures only
- Pure functions wherever possible
- No nested if/else - use early returns or composition
- Prefer simple, self-documenting code. Comments explaining WHY (not WHAT) are welcome when needed. If WHAT needs explanation, the code may be too complex or clever.
- Prefer options objects/dicts over positional parameters
- Use functional patterns:
  - **TypeScript/Python**: `map`, `filter`, `reduce` over loops
  - **Go**: prefer explicit loops with clear intent, avoid mutation
  - **Python**: list comprehensions, generator expressions
  - **TypeScript**: avoid `for...in`, use `for...of` or array methods

For detailed patterns and examples, load the `functional` skill.

## Development Workflow

**Core principle**: RED-GREEN-REFACTOR in small, known-good increments. TDD is the fundamental practice.

**Quick reference:**
- RED: Write failing test first (NO production code without failing test)
- GREEN: Write MINIMUM code to pass test
- REFACTOR: Assess improvement opportunities (only refactor if adds value)
- **Wait for commit approval** before every commit
- Each increment leaves codebase in working state
- Capture learnings as they occur, merge at end

For detailed TDD workflow, load the `tdd` skill.
For refactoring methodology, load the `refactoring` skill.
For significant work, load the `planning` skill for three-document model (PLAN.md, WIP.md, LEARNINGS.md).

## Working with Claude

**Core principle**: Think deeply, follow TDD strictly, capture learnings while context is fresh.

**Quick reference:**
- ALWAYS FOLLOW TDD - no production code without failing test
- Assess refactoring after every green (but only if adds value)
- Update CLAUDE.md when introducing meaningful changes
- Ask "What do I wish I'd known at the start?" after significant changes
- Document gotchas, patterns, decisions, edge cases while context is fresh

For detailed TDD workflow, load the `tdd` skill.
For refactoring methodology, load the `refactoring` skill.
For detailed guidance on expectations and documentation, load the `expectations` skill.

## Configuration Management

**Core principle**: Separate secrets from application config. Never commit credentials.

**Pattern for secrets (credentials, API keys):**
- File: `secrets.yaml` (or `secrets.json`, `.env`)
- In `.gitignore`: YES
- Example file: `secrets.yaml.example` with placeholder values
- Committed: Example only, never actual secrets

**Pattern for application config (non-secret settings):**
- File: `config.yaml` (or `config.json`)
- In `.gitignore`: YES (allows per-deployment customization)
- Example file: `config.yaml.example` with defaults/documentation
- Committed: Example only

**Example structure:**
```yaml
# secrets.yaml.example
airtable:
  api_key: patXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.your_api_key_here
  base_id: appXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

# config.yaml.example
default_email_domain: ""  # Optional: domain to append to usernames
```

**Setup instructions (README.md):**
```bash
cp secrets.yaml.example secrets.yaml
cp config.yaml.example config.yaml
# Edit both files with actual values
```

**Loading pattern (Python/Pydantic):**
- Secrets: Load from `secrets.yaml`, fail if missing required values
- Config: Load from `config.yaml`, use defaults if file missing or values empty
- Validate at load time with Pydantic models

## Summary

The key is to write clean, testable, functional code that evolves through small, safe increments. Every change should be driven by a test that describes the desired behavior, and the implementation should be the simplest thing that makes that test pass. When in doubt, favor simplicity and readability over cleverness.
